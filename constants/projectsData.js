The temporary shelters for the workers contrast with the splendor of the project they're working on. A location along the way acts as a facility for goods and vehicles to emerge from cliff tunnels, and be transported to the renovation site that is at a height.\n\n I honed my 3D modelling quite a bit along the way.",
